# Linear and Logistic Regression
In this project, I built a linear model and interpret the results of the model.
Specifically, look at what variables are related to salaries.  

### Project Instructions
There are three sections of this project that you will need to complete. Below you will find directions to assist with each portion of this project.

### Data Description
In this portion of the presentation, you should describe at least the following aspects of the dataset:
*  the number of employees that are in the dataset
*  how missing data were handled
*  the range of salaries
*  any plots or estimates that suggest certain features in the dataset are likely correlated to salary

### Regression Results
In this portion of the presentation, you should
*  share the regression output associated with your linear model
*  identify which variables are statistically significant in their relationship with salary
*  remove variables from the model that are not statistically significant
*  identify how well the model fits the data

### Interpretation of Model Results
In this portion of the presentation, you should choose two variables in the model and provide:
*  the expected range of change in salary related to changes in this variable
*  how confident you are that these changes are likely to happen
